### 1) External Sensors and Data Collection Devices:
A list of all devices:
- Aeroqual Series 200, 300, 500 air chemical composition sensors
- MultiRAE Series gas analyzers
- Decagon Devices 5TE soil chemical composition sensors
- YSI ProDSS (Digital Sampling System) water quality sensors
- InfraCal TOG/TPH Analyzers for oil product detection

They are responsible for collecting environmental data and asynchronously sending it to the IoT Service.

### 2) Internet of Things Service (Azure IoT Hub):
This service acts as a mediator between external sensors and the rest of the system. It receives data sent via MQTT protocol from the sensors, publishes it as events, and sends it to the Event Processor.

### 3) Event Processor (Apache Kafka, SignalR):
This container acts as the central event streaming platform. It subscribes to events published by the IoT service. Upon receiving the data, the event processor can perform real-time data processing and send notifications to subscribed clients via SignalR.

### 4) API Application (C# ASP.NET):
This is the backend application written in C# ASP.NET. It interacts with the event processor to receive processed data, handles all logic, manipulates data, and presents processed data to the front-end. It also performs read and write operations with the database.

### 5) Database (Apache Cassandra):
This NoSQL database stores all data processed through the API Application.

### 6) SPA:
This is the graphical user interface of the application written in JavaScript and Angular. It makes API calls to the backend via HTTPS protocol to obtain or send data. It also presents data to users in an interactive and user-friendly format.

### 7) Monitoring Service (Prometheus):
This third-party service is used by the system administrator and technical engineer to obtain metrics for monitoring the system. It also interacts with the event processor and API Application to collect performance data.

### Users:
Various types of users (researcher, end-user, system administrator, technical engineer) who interact with the system via GUI or API. Each type of user has its own access level and capabilities.

### External Sensors and Devices:
These include air, water, soil, and oil product quality sensors that send data to the system.

### SPA (Single Page Application):
Implemented using JavaScript and Angular, serves as the user interface (GUI).

### Security Module:
This component is responsible for security, authentication, authorization, and data encryption.

### Data Processing Module:
Receives data, filters it, aggregates it, and sends events to other modules.

### Event Processor Module:
Uses Apache Kafka and SignalR for real-time event processing, allowing the system to respond quickly to changes.

### Caching Module:
Stores frequently requested data for quick access using the Time-to-Live pattern, Redis.

### Data Backup & Recovery Module:
Ensures system recovery after failures, adhering to established recovery time objectives (RTO/RPO).

### Database Module:
Uses Apache Cassandra to store data, including user data history, system events, and aggregated data.

### System Operation Logic:
- Sensors collect data about the environment and send it to the system through IoT services and monitoring services.
- The data processing module receives the incoming data, processes it, and publishes events that are then consumed by the event streaming module.
- Data is cached for quick access and stored in the database for historical analysis and reporting.
- Users interact with the system through the web application, where they can view data and receive reports.
- The security module ensures data protection and user access management.
- In the event of a failure, the backup and recovery module ensures system restoration using saved data backups.

### CacheManager
**Purpose:** Manages data caching.

**Fields:** 
- `redisClient`: An instance of RedisClient used to interact with the Redis caching system.
- `cacheMetrics`: An instance of CacheMetrics used to track cache performance metrics such as hits and misses.
- `logger`: An instance of Logger used to log actions and errors related to cache operations. 

**Methods:**
- `initializeCache()`: Initializes the caching system.
- `set(key, value, ttl)`: Stores a value in the cache with a time-to-live (ttl) specification.
- `get(key)`: Retrieves a value from the cache.
- `delete(key)`: Removes a value from the cache.
- `exists(key)`: Checks for the existence of a key in the cache.
